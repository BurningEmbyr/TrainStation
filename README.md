# TrainStation
TrainStation is an RPG campaign tool built by Daniel Gordon and Jeffrey DiVincent.

Specifically, it is a centralized dice roller and campaign aid utility built for DMs.

## Features (planned)
- Fully functional public and private pseudo-random die rolls
- The ability for DMs to modify die rolls made by players without their knowledge, before the die rolls display
- Room/password generation, using a service hosted on AWS
  - Perhaps a peer-to-peer version in the future?
- Misc. campaign management features (notes, character stats)
